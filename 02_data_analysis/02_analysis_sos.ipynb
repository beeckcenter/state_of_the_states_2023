Virginians are moving to states with lower taxes and lower cost of living and as those Virginians pack up and move away so go the jobs, investments, and tax revenue they drive.  Across the United States in the last fiscal year alone, economic development projects were announced representing over 600,000 jobs and nearly $400 billion in capital investment.', 'We’ve proven this by making investments in roads, rail and broadband to help Virginians stay connected.

Folks, this is the people’s money, and it’s only right, while still acknowledging we are recording revenues far exceeding normal and sustainable levels, we give a fair share of this money directly back to the people of Alabama.  While there is still uncertainty in our national economic climate, we must create stability here at home.

But we’re at a crossroads.Increased demand, chronic and extreme drought, conflicts with other states, and devastatingclimate events are threatening this critical lifesource – and we’ve all seen the impacts.Wildfires have destroyed hundreds of thousands of acres, and devastated entire communities.Farmers and ranchers across the state fear that Colorado won’t have the water resources tosustain the next generation of agricultural jobs.When Colorado is 150, I want our state to have the water resources necessary for our farms,communities, and industries to thrive, and the tools in place to protect our state’s waterways anddefend our rights.Your work around housing will truly go a long way to protect water -  our most preciousresource. But we must also continue investing in water projects around the state.We don’t want to see a single dollar left on the table.For every dollar the state invested in Water Plan grants last year, we got four dollars back. In thelast fiscal year, we awarded more than $23 million in grants that supported nearly $100 million inprojects, and we’re hoping to once again position Colorado to punch above our weight and pulldown major investments from the federal government.This includes funding for water infrastructure and water quality projects like the Arkansas ValleyConduit.', 'In thelast fiscal year, we awarded more than $23 million in grants that supported nearly $100 million inprojects, and we’re hoping to once again position Colorado to punch above our weight and pulldown major investments from the federal government.This includes funding for water infrastructure and water quality projects like the Arkansas ValleyConduit.

We must talk about the challenge of our time: Arizona’s decades-long drought, over usage of the Colorado River, and the combined ramifications on our water supply, our forests, and our communities.  We are in a critical moment where we must be unified, where we must form new and stronger partnerships, and where we must find bipartisan solutions at a local, statewide, and national level.

We should follow in their footsteps as we collectively face a drought unlike anything in modern times.  On January 1, the Colorado River Tier 2 mandatory water cuts went into effect – meaning Arizona will lose 21 percent of our water that comes from the most important river in the country.

Tonight, I’m proud to report that, despite everything we have been through – including a pandemic, tornadoes, flooding, ice storms, a polar plunge, temporary but tough inflation and even a war in Europe – the state of the commonwealth is still strong, and our future is bright. We enter 2023 with hope and optimism, after setting record highs in economic development and record lows in unemployment.
