       "\"MADISON — Gov. Tony Evers announced today his appointment of Clifford Burdon to serve as Marquette County District Attorney. The appointment fills a vacancy created by former District Attorney Brian J. Juech’s resignation. Burdon will serve for the remainder of the unexpired term that ends January 2025.  “Clifford Burdon brings experience and continuity to the Marquette County District Attorney’s Office,” said Gov. Evers. “He will serve the people of Marquette County well as their next district attorney.”  Burdon is currently the Assistant District Attorney in the Marquette County District Attorney’s Office and has been a prosecutor for more than a decade, previously working in the Juneau, Fond du Lac, and Columbia County District Attorney Offices. Prior to his current role and earlier in his career, Burdon was a criminal defense attorney. Over his career as a prosecutor and defense attorney, he has handled various criminal matters and dozens of jury trials.  “Governor Evers has made an excellent choice in appointing Cliff Burdon as Marquette County District Attorney,” said Marquette County Sheriff Joseph Konrath. “Mr. Burdon is an intelligent and experienced prosecutor. Our Sheriff's Office looks forward to working with our new District Attorney to ensure public safety while treating everyone with dignity and respect.”  Burdon is active in professional and community organizations, having served as vice president of the Columbia County Bar Association in 2011 and 2018, and volunteered with the Pardeeville Watermelon Festival for many years. He will be relocating to Marquette County to serve in this role.  “I am honored to accept the appointment by Governor Evers to serve as District Attorney for Marquette County,” said Burdon. “As District Attorney, I look forward to working alongside our excellent law enforcement with my dedicated staff serving our community in our pursuit of justice.”  A photo of Burdon is available here.\""

       "'MADISON — Gov. Tony Evers, together with the Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Trade, and Consumer Protection (DATCP), announced that 20 recipients are receiving grant funding for the 2023 Commercial Nitrogen Optimization Pilot Program (NOPP). These grants aim to refine and enhance the understanding of new methods that optimize commercial nitrogen applied to agricultural fields, helping to protect vital soil and water resources.  “This pilot program is a great way to bring together partners in this work, from farmers and producers to conservation professionals, to promote collaboration and find best practices to ensure that we are protecting our state’s natural resources from harmful contaminants while helping farmers protect their bottom line,” said Gov. Evers. “Farmers know firsthand the value of having clean water and fruitful land, and we are glad to continue to invest in and support producer-led conservation efforts in my 2023-25 biennial budget so farmers can continue to stay innovative and productive for years to come.”  “As stewards of the land, Wisconsin farmers understand that our rich soil and water resources are our strength, and they work tirelessly to ensure that our farmland is maintained for future generations,” said DATCP Secretary Randy Romanski. “Thanks to Governor Evers and the Legislature, these grants will give farmers across the state the opportunity to continue identifying new opportunities in nitrogen optimization.”  The NOPP was designed to encourage agricultural producers to develop innovative approaches to optimize the application of commercial nitrogen for a duration of at least two growing seasons. The selected producers must collaborate with a University of Wisconsin (UW) System institution, which will monitor the grant project on-site and conduct commercial nitrogen optimization field studies.  Funding for the NOPP and the cover crop insurance premium rebate program, which assists farmers with rebates of $5 per acre of a cover crop planted for crop insurance premiums paid on those acres, was announced last summer. These programs were created under 2021 Wisconsin Act 223, legislation put forth by the bipartisan Water Quality Task Force and signed into law by Gov. Evers in April 2022. Building on these efforts to conserve and protect Wisconsin’s soil and water resources, Gov. Evers’ 2023-25 biennial budget proposes to provide $2.4 million in each year of the biennium to continue the NOPP, as well as the cover crop insurance program.  The grant structure allowed agricultural producers to work together and apply under a single application, with each individual producer eligible to receive a maximum award of up to $50,000. Of each of the grants, up to 20 percent will be awarded to the UW System for monitoring and research assistance. The application period for the program closed on Jan. 31, 2023.  DATCP received 31 funding applications totaling more than $2.1 million in requests. The grant recipients and their planned projects, totaling nearly $1.6 million, are:  Joe Ailts | $43,505 Explore organic and inorganic nitrogen soil testing as a means to reduce nitrogen applications.

       "'MADISON — Gov. Tony Evers today joined a broad-based group of climate, energy, environmental justice, and conservation organizations, businesses, and allies in Milwaukee to celebrate the official launch of the new Clean Economy Coalition of Wisconsin (CECW).  “Today, we have an historic opportunity to define Wisconsin as a clean economy state—to build a workforce, economy, and state that’s prepared for the 21st century, reduce reliance on out-of-state energy sources and lower energy bills for working families, and create new jobs and apprenticeships in innovative industries,” said Gov. Evers. “Now is the time for us to double our efforts to build the future we want for our state, and I’m so excited for the role the Clean Economy Coalition of Wisconsin is going to play in our efforts to do just that.”  The CECW seeks to leverage the combined strength of its members to enhance the quality of life of all Wisconsinites by accelerating the state’s transition to a clean energy economy. Founding members of the Coalition include Action for the Climate Emergency, Audubon Great Lakes, Clean Wisconsin, Elevate, The Nature Conservancy, RENEW Wisconsin, Sierra Club Wisconsin Chapter, Slipstream, Wisconsin Conservation Voters, Walnut Way Conservation Corp., Wisconsin Health Professionals for Climate Action, and Wisconsin Land and Water Conservation Association.  “As a Coalition, our priority is to achieve statewide decarbonization by 2050 through people-first policies that create jobs for Wisconsin workers, build healthier communities and protect our natural resources,” said Sam Dunaiski, Executive Director of RENEW Wisconsin. “We know that together, we can advance clean energy solutions that accelerate economic development, while increasing Wisconsin’s energy independence.”  Though the CECW formally launched today, members have been working together for years to advance Wisconsin’s clean energy policy.  “We’re here to meet an historic moment,” said Jennifer Giegerich, Government Affairs Director for Wisconsin Conservation Voters. “Wisconsin has a proud tradition of environmental stewardship. From the original Indigenous stewards to the birthplace of Earth Day, Wisconsin’s legacy is rooted in conservation and stewardship. And the current combination of local action, state leadership, and federal opportunity is allowing us to embark on a new era for Wisconsin’s people, environment, and economy.”  The Coalition’s 2023 policy agenda is built upon six core pillars—the tenets of a clean economy.  Healthy economy A robust economy is necessary to move our state forward. The CECW supports efforts and policies that ensure households’ health, jobs, and choices for tomorrow are better than they are today.   Environmental justice and infrastructure The CECW puts racial and economic justice at the center of its work because there are can’t-wait communities already experiencing the impacts of climate change. The CECW aims to be the bridge between the lived experiences of climate and energy consequences and the arenas where policy decisions are made.   Carbon-free power The CECW shapes and advocates for policies that support a 100 percent carbon-free state by 2050. The CECW supports energy freedom through increased access to clean power, allowing new sources of clean and renewable power generation to be a part of the state’s clean economy future.   Home and building repair The CECW advocates and acts for policies to achieve 100 percent zero carbon new residential and commercial buildings by 2030 and to facilitate the reduction of building sector energy use by 50 percent by 2030. The CECW will work to phase out the use of natural gas in existing homes and businesses to prioritize retrofitting and weatherization and to reduce the energy burden on households who can least afford it.   Thriving landscapes Wisconsin’s economy relies on thriving landscapes that support productive agriculture, resilient cities, and valued natural areas. The CECW will advocate for natural climate solutions that protect land and water while providing economic growth to both rural and urban communities.   Next-gen transportation The CECW works with partners across all sectors to ease the road for the transition to electric and low-carbon transportation, advocating and acting to make the transition to electric vehicles cost-effective, easy, and equitable, with a goal of over 50 percent of new car sales being electric by 2030.   “We believe we have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to accelerate our state’s transition to a clean economy,” said Matt Kruger, Executive Director of the Wisconsin Land and Water Conservation Association. “There’s so much about the identity of our state that’s tied to our rural heritage and agriculture, which has been in flux over the last few decades. We are advocating for natural climate solutions for both rural and urban communities to help spur our state’s economy.”  Gov. Evers has been a leader in combatting the climate crisis and is committed to building a clean energy economy in Wisconsin. From joining the U.S. Climate Alliance, a bipartisan coalition of governors committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions consistent with the goals of the Paris Agreement, to creating the Governor’s Task Force on Climate Change to releasing the state’s first-ever Clean Energy Plan, which many of the partners behind the CECW played a role in building, Wisconsin continues to advance towards a clean energy economy under Gov. Evers’ leadership. The governor’s 2023-25 biennial budget proposal builds on this work and includes several provisions recommended by the state’s Office of Sustainability and Clean Energy and the Clean Energy Plan. Implementing the state’s Clean Energy Plan is expected to lower energy bills for families, reduce reliance on out-of-state energy sources, invest in job and apprenticeship training, and create more than 40,000 jobs by 2030. In addition, this plan also supports the governor’s ambitious commitment to making Wisconsin’s electricity production 100 percent carbon-free by 2050.    Gov. Evers’ 2023-25 budget proposal includes many key investments in building a clean energy economy, promoting clean energy production and energy efficiency, and supporting and creating jobs in the clean energy sector. The governor’s budget invests in building the state’s clean energy workforce, increases funding for the state’s Focus on Energy program, and supports small businesses in the clean energy sector and local communities in resiliency planning efforts. Additionally, the governor is proposing key initiatives to build out Wisconsin’s electric vehicle charging station network to accelerate the deployment and adoption of electric vehicles in Wisconsin, lowering emissions and improving air quality for all Wisconsinites.  More information regarding the governor’s proposals to protect and conserve Wisconsin’s natural resources and promote a clean energy economy and workforce is available here.     More information about the Clean Economy Coalition of Wisconsin, its members, and its policy goals is available here.'"
